		<h3><b><i>Discover essential tips and techniques for maintaining 			the beauty and longevity of cut flowers, from preparation to 				preservation:</i></b></h3>
		<br />
		
		<h2><font color="#6094C9"><u>Cutting and Conditioning</u></font></h2>
		
		
		<ul type="circle">
			<li><b>Choose the Right Tools:</b> Use sharp, clean scissors or 			floral shears to cut flower stems at a 45-degree angle. This 				ensures a clean cut that allows for better water absorption.</li>
			<li><b>Timing:</b>Harvest flowers in the early morning or late 				evening when they are well-hydrated and temperatures are 				cooler.</li>
			<li><b>Water Temperature:</b> Fill a clean vase with lukewarm water 			and add floral preservative to nourish flowers and inhibit 				bacterial growth.</li>
			<li><b>Remove Foliage:</b>Strip lower leaves from stems to prevent 			them from sitting in water, which can lead to bacterial growth and 			shorten vase life.</li>			
		</ul>
		<br />
		
		<h2><font color="#6094C9"><u>Arranging Flowers in Vases:</u></font></h2>
		
		
		<ul type="circle">
			<li><b>Create a Framework:</b>Start with a focal flower (e.g., 				roses or lilies) and build around it with complementary blooms and 			foliage.</li>
			<li><b>Cutting Heights:</b>Trim stems to varying lengths for depth 			and dimension. Arrange taller flowers towards the center and 				shorter ones around the edges.</li>
			<li><b>Balance and Symmetry:</b>Aim for a balanced arrangement by 			distributing colors and textures evenly. Consider the vase shape 			and size to achieve proportional balance.</li>

		</ul>
		<br />

		<h2><font color="#6094C9"><u>Preserving Flowers:</u></font></h2>
		<ul type="circle">
			<li><b>Drying Flowers: </b>Preserve flowers by hanging them upside 			down in a dry, dark area for several weeks. Use silica gel or 				desiccants to speed up the drying process.</li>
			<li><b>Pressing Flowers:</b>Press flowers between heavy books or 			using a flower press to flatten and preserve them for crafts, 				cards, or framed displays.</li>		

		</ul>
		<br />
	
		<h2><font color="#6094C9"><u>Longevity Tips:</u></font></h2>
				
		
		<ul type="circle">
			<li><b>Change Water Regularly:</b>Refresh vase water every 2-3 days 			to prevent bacterial buildup and maintain flower freshness.</li>
			<li><b>Trim Stems:</b> Recut flower stems every few days to remove 			any blocked or slimy sections and improve water uptake.</li>
			<li><b>Avoid Direct Sunlight and Heat:</b>Keep floral arrangements 			away from direct sunlight, drafts, and heat sources to prolong 				bloom life.</li>
			

		</ul>
		<br />
		<br />
	
		<h2><font color="#6094C9"><u>Special Care for Specific Flowers:</u></font>		</h2>
				
		
		<ul type="circle">
			<li><b>Roses:</b>Remove thorns and outer petals for a clean 				appearance. Change water daily to extend vase life.
			</li>
			<li><b>Tulips:</b>Place tulips in shallow water to prevent stems 			from bending. Add a penny to the vase to keep tulips upright.</li>
			<li><b>Orchids:</b> Mist orchid blooms with water to maintain 				humidity. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
